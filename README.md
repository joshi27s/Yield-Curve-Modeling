# Yield-Curve-Modeling


In this research, I am forecasting the yield curve using the dynamic Nelson Siegel model proposed by Dielbold and Li (2006). The file contains MATLAB codes, results and explanations.
This is work in progress.

To view the latent updates and analysis on the Bayesian and frequentists' methods that I have employed, please check the following google document:
